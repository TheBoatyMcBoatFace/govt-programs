        This topic is focused on new artificial intelligence (AI) tools that enhance the productivity of scientists and
        engineers when making use of scholarly publications and engaging in interdisciplinary interactions in the areas
        of science and engineering supported by SC. While scientists are deeply knowledgeable in their areas of
        expertise, they are often not as highly informed in other important disciplines. For example, experts in several
        subareas of high-performance computing are not as deeply knowledgeable about the terminology, concepts,
        and state of the art in other areas such as biological sciences or high energy physics. The advent of new
        service-oriented access to technology that is based on large language models (LLM), which may include multimodal data, has now opened the possibility of utilizing LLM-based commercial services to enable new
        interdisciplinary synergy. These services can now be envisioned to be used to digest large amounts of scientific
        publications and documentation across disciplines and enable interdisciplinary interactions that were not
        conceivable before.
        Against this backdrop, grant applications are sought on the topic of “AI Tools for Catalyzing Interdisciplinary
        Science.” This topic will be focused on increasing the synergy among disciplines supported by the Office of
        Science. For example, this would include AI-based tools that can catalyze the interactions among scientists in
        nuclear physics and material sciences. Innovative methods are needed to assimilate the scientific publication
        corpus of two or more disciplines and enable scientists in any of those disciplines to collate scientific ideas,
        concepts, questions, and solutions from the other disciplines.
        Included in scope is the integration with commercial AI services (Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, etc.) and
        open/commercial sources of publications and other data. Proposed approaches must display a short-term path
        to success and commercial viability. The proposed work should include a plan to perform demonstration
        activities with scientists and demonstrate verification and validation of results, including data validation.
        Grant applications focused on the following will be considered out of scope:
         Tools that address less than two scientific disciplines in Office of Science research areas.
         Tools that build LLM-based services from scratch.
         Security and hardening of LLM.
